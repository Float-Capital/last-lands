# Hackathon

## The why
[Jasoons](https://github.com/jasoons) and [myself](https://github.com/denhampreen) are driven by innovate and novel tech, economics and merging these together to drive impact. **The Last Lands** gamifies the concept that the worlds environmental resources are running out, and that the public good that is the environment will not be here for ever. 

## The how

The Last Lands is our brain child game leveraging the funding mechanism of [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) and on-chain gaming to fund public goods. The lands are represented by [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721) tokens and are represented on-chain by their 2 digit country code. The contracts are indexed using [Envio](https://envio.dev) and the front-end is built in ReactJS. 

## The what

**The Last Lands** is a social impact public goods funding game. The basic concept of the game is that a land (country) goes on auction once a day for 206 days, until there are no more countries left. Once all the countries are sold, there is a daily battle between the countries until there is one country left standing which is marked as the winner. 

50% of the proceeds of each auction goes towards funding the environment. The other 50% goes into a pool which is claimable by the winning land at the end of the game.
